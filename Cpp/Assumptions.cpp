Assumptions:-

The given user ID has O(n) first level connections and each connection has O(n) connections in return(possibly overlapping)

Complexity analysis:-

Steps:-

1) Generating first level connections - constant time. (Single API call) 
2) Generating 2nd level connections  - O(n). (n users * constant time first level connec)
